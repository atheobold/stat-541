| Learning Objective           | Mastery                                                                                                                 | Proficient                                                                                                                                    | Novice                                                                                                         |

| DM-4: Data Collection        | I can...                                                                                                                | I can scrape multiple elements from a webpage.                                                                                                | I can scrape simple elements from a webpage.                                                                   |
| CD-1: Vectorized Functions   | Vectorization is used consistently — every function uses it                                                             | Vectorization is used sporadically — some functions use it and some don't                                                                     | Vectorization is not used when writing functions                                                               |
| CD-2: Intermediate Objects   | Immaculate R workspace – intermediate objects are not used unless absolutely necessary                                  | Mostly clean R workspace – intermediate objects are [occasionally]{.underline} used when they are not needed                                  | Cluttered R workspace – intermediate objects are [frequently]{.underline} used when they are not needed        |
| CD-3: Supporting Functions   | Helper functions are used consistently — helper functions are used for every complex process (requiring multiple steps) | Helper functions are used sporadically — some steps are broken out into smaller functions, but others are left in the body of large functions | Functions are not deconstructed into parts — few if any helper functions are used                              |
| TC-2: Function Documentation | Comments guide the reader through each step of the function                                                             | Comments guide the reader through the "major" parts of the function                                                                           | Few if any comments are used in the body of the function to guide the reader through the process being enacted |
| RW-3: Code style             | Code completely follows the tidyverse / Google style guide                                                              | The majority of the time the code **does follow** the tidyverse / Google style guide                                                          | The majority of the time the code **does not follow** the tidyverse / Google style guide                       |
| DM-2: Iteration              | `map()` or `apply()` functions are used for every iteration                                                             | `map()` or `apply()` functions are used for every iteration                                                                                   | Every iteration is done using a `for()` loop                                                                   |
