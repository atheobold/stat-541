(Since Week 1 consists of review of Stat 331 material, you should be able to skip some of the required readings and viewings. It is your responsibility to decide which areas you need to review before diving into Stat 431.)


```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
make_summary_table(vid_time = "6 min", 
                   reading_time = "0-90 min", 
                   work_time = "0-15 min", 
                   canvas_activities = 2)
```

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}

* [RStudio Cheatsheets](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) are a great shortcut resource to have on hand, to remind you of which functions exist and what they do.
* The [R for Data Science Textbook](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) is free online.
* [RStudio's Primers](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers) are interactive lessons on the basics of R; these would be a great way to refresh your knowledge.

## The Grammar of Graphics

You should feel comfortable with:

* Knowing what goes into an aesthetic (`aes()`) versus the geometry (`geom_*()`)

* Identifying these elements of existing plots


```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
req_vid("Grammar of Graphics with ggplot2", type = "Required", url = "https://www.youtube.com/embed/kepKM7Z2O54")
```

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
checkin("Grammar of Graphics")
```

Identify the elements of the following plot as

(i) The aesthetic
(ii) The geometry
(iii) The scales
(iv) None of the above

<a href=<https://xkcd.com/252/"><img src="./Images/xkcd.png"></a>

(a) The x-axis is age
(b) The y-axis is "Urge to run up the down escalator"
(c) The y-axis ranges from "Weak" to "Strong"
(d) This is a line graph
(e) The two lines are "What I was supposed to feel" and "What I've actually felt"
(f) The lines are labeled with text
(g) Only even ages are labelled
(h) Stick figure people are sliding down the line


```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
canvas_task(quiz_url)
```


## Using ggplot2

You should be comfortable with:

* Using the "big 5" geometries

* Changing optional arguments.

* faceting

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
req_read("RStudio Primer: Data Visualization", url = "https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/3", type = "Required")
```


```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
req_read("R4DS Chapter 3: Data Visualisation", url = "https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html", type = "Recommended")
```


```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
checkin("ggplot")
```

Fill in the blanks for the following plot:

```{r ggplot, include = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
starwars %>%
  filter(species == "Human") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = height, y = mass, color = gender)) + 
  geom_point(pch = 17) +
  ggtitle("Heights and Weights of Humans in Star Wars")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
decorate("ggplot") %>%
  mask("filter ", background = "#fdff32")%>%
  mask("x ", background = "#fdff32") %>%
  mask("y ", background = "#fdff32") %>%
  mask("color", background = "#fdff32") %>%
  mask("pch ", background = "#fdff32") %>%
  mask("point", background = "#fdff32")  %>%
  mask("ggtitle", background = "#fdff32") 
```



```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
canvas_task(quiz_url)
```
