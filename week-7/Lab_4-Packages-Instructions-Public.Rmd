## Intro

In this lab, you (and possibly a group) will create your very own small R Package!

Start brainstorming ideas for what you want your package to do.  There are no 
restrictions here - whatever you are excited to work on or think would be useful
is acceptable. 

Here are some ideas to get you started:

* A package that makes shortcut functions for common data wrangling pipelines.
* A package that makes shortcut functions for particular types of plots, or common
combinations of plots.
* A package that creates some new ggplot themes.
* A package with functions that automatically pull updated data from an API and 
perform certain analyses.
* A package that takes user-provided text file and performs interesting text 
analyses.
* A package that teaches or explains basic statistical concepts.
* (If you're feeling ambitious) A package that makes [new R Markdown formats and/or
templates.](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/new-formats.html)


(It is definitely okay if your package duplicate parts of existing
packages, as long as all your code is your own.)


## What's in a name?

Once you have a general idea of your goals for your package, come up with a good
name for it.

A good package name:

* Is descriptive of what the package does; e.g. `stringr` handles strings.
* Is easy to remember how to spell and capitalize; e.g. `sPonGEboB` would be a bad name.
* Contains no spaces or special characters, and ideally no numbers.

The R community also likes to have some fun with package names; if your package
is a pun (like `lubridate`) or uses the letter R in a fun way (like `purrr`),
it is even easier to remember and to market.


## Create the basic folder structure


**Everyone** in your group should first make sure they have the important packages
installed:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("devtools", "usethis", "roxygen2", "testthat", "knitr"))
```

Your **group leader** will now need to create the initial empty
package.  We recommend that the other group members try this out as well, for 
practice, or that the group leader uses a Video Chat app to screenshare during
this process.

#### STEP ONE:
Make a Git Repository somewhere on your computer (the Desktop, or your Stat 431 
folder, would be good choices).  

Name this repository the same name as your package.

We recommend using *GitHub Desktop* or similar to do this:

![](../Images/new_git_repo.gif)

Select the following options:
* *Initialize Repository with a ReadMe:*  Check the box.
* *Git Ignore:* R
* *License:* MIT



#### STEP TWO:
Figure out the *path* to your new repository folder.  This might look something like
```
/Users/reginageorge/Desktop/meangirls/
```

In your *console*, run the following:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(usethis)
create_package("/Users/reginageorge/Desktop/meangirls/")
```

(but of course, replace the path with your own path)

#### STEP THREE:
Set up some preliminaries.

We'll now walk through a couple `usethis` functions that make your package-building
life easier.  In the RStudio project that opened automatically for your package
run each of the following code chunks in your console.


```{r, eval = FALSE}
use_mit_license("Your Name")
```
*This function establishes an open-source copyright for the package, in your name.*

```{r, eval = FALSE}
use_roxygen_md()
```
*This function makes it easier to build function documentation automatically, by
using `#' @param` type comments like you saw in the `meangirls` package.*

```{r, eval = FALSE}
use_testthat()
```

*This function sets up the unit test folder for you, like you saw in the `meangirls`
package*

```{r, eval = FALSE}
use_pipe()
```

*This function prepares your package to allow you to sue the pipe (`%>%`) in the
functions you write.*


#### STEP FOUR:
Commit and push your newly created package to GitHub

#### STEP FIVE:
Log in to your GitHub account online.

First, make sure your repository is public.

![](../Images/make_repo_public.gif)

Then give your group members access to the repository, by adding them as collaborators.

## How to contribute

**After this point, NOBODY should EVER push changes to the repository directly!!!**

Instead, you should all - including the Group Leader - contribute via *Pull Request.*

Recall from the coursework practice that the easiest way to do
this process is with the functions in the `usethis` package:

* `create_from_github()` to fork the repository and clone it to computer (Only
needs to be done once per package. The Group Leader will be able to skip this step
since they will already have the repository on their local computer.)
* `pr_pull_upstream()` to make sure you are all up-to-date with changes to the repo.
* `pr_init("branch_name")` to create a new branch for a new set of proposed edits.
* (Don't forget to *commit* your changes as you work!)
* `pr_push()` to create a pull request from those edits

Since your whole group has access to the repository, everyone has the power to
*merge* their own pull request.

#### Trust us on this one

This may seem like a roundabout way to make progress - since everyone has access
to the repository, why not just push the changes directly?

We promise you that getting in the habit of the "Branch and Pull Request" workflow
will save you time and headache in the long run.

When all "subprojects" of your repository have their own branch, this prevents
people frome "breaking" each other's code.  It also makes it much easier to follow
the thought process of the package, and to "undo" changes if you change your mind
later.

### Try it!

Each group member should practice this process by adding themselves as an author
and creator in the `NAMESPACE` file.

Do this one at a time, waiting for the previous Pull Request to be merged before
starting the next one, to keep from *conflicts* of editing the same file.

If anything in this process feels confusing, or if you run into snags, this is a 
great time to reach out to your professors for help.


## And you're off to the races!

You're now ready for the fun part: writing your package!


For full credit, your package must meet the following requirements:

#### Package Description
The "Title", "Authors", and "Description" section of the `DESCRIPTION` file
must be properly filled out.  (You may ignore the other fields.)


#### Package Functionality
There must be at least three `.R` files in the `/R/` folder.

Each file must contain at least one "major" function - i.e., a function that
is part of the core purpose of the package - that is "exported" to the namespace.

Each file must contain at least one "helper" function.  It is up to you
whether to "export" this function or not.

These do not have to be earth-shattering, game-changing functions!  Anything that
is well-written and helpful is sufficient, even if the scope is small.

#### Unit tests
Every function must have appropriate unit tests written in the `/testthat/` folder.

You can auto-generate the file for a unit test by running

```{r, eval = FALSE}
use_test("function_name")
```

All your unit tests should pass.  Recall that you can check this by *building* 
the package (`Ctrl-Shift-B`) and then *testing* the package (`Ctrl-Shift-T`)

#### Package Documentation
All functions must have proper documentation, using the "roxygen" style comments
(`#'`).  Refer to the `meangirls` package for examples.

You only need to have:
* What the function does.
* The arguments (`@param`)
* The output (`@return`)
* Any necessary *dependencies* (`@import` or `@importFrom`)
* An `@export` statment, if you want the function to be in the Namespace.

There are many other optional documentation elements, but these are not required.

After editing or adding to documentation via `#'` comments, make sure you re-generate
the documentation files.  (`Ctrl-Shift-D`)

You can check out your documentation by building the package (`Ctrl-Shift-B`),
and then trying `?function_name`.


#### Challenge: CRAN Check

Recall that the requirements for being accepted to CRAN are quite strict. If you 
want to take this Lab a step further, consider trying to make a package that
meets these requirements.

You can see if your package is in tip-top shape by clicking the "Check" button
under the "Build" pane in RStudio.
