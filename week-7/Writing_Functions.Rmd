Before we start developing our very own R Packages, let's review the basic building 
blocks of R programming: **functions**.


```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
make_summary_table(vid_time = "55 min", 
                   reading_time = "30 min", 
                   work_time = "0 min", 
                   canvas_activities = 6)
```

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
extra_rec("")
```

## Basics of Functions

If you do not recall the basics of writing functions, or if you want a quick refresher,
watch the video below.

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
req_vid("How to Write a Function", type = "Optional", url = "https://youtu.be/zA5eVuUMM8U")
```


### Anatomy of a function definition

Let's establish some vocabulary moving forward.   Consider the very simple function below:

```{r addtwo}
add_or_subtract <- function(first_num, second_num = 2, type = "add") {
  
  if (type == "add") {
    first_num + second_num
  } else if (type == "subtract") {
    first_num - second_num
  } else {
    stop("Please choose `add` or `subtract` as the type.")
  }
  
}
  
```

The **function name** is chosen by whoever writes the function:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate("addtwo") %>%
  flair("add_or_subtract")
```

The **required arguments** are the ones for which no default value is supplied:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate("addtwo") %>%
  flair("first_num,")
```

The **optional arguments** are the ones for which a default value is supplied.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate("addtwo") %>%
  flair('second_num = 2, type = "add"')
```

The **body of the function** is all the code inside the definition.  This code will be
run in the **environment of the function**, rather than in the **global environment**.
This means that code in the body of the function does *not* have the power to alter
anything outside the function.

*(There are ways to cheat your way around this... we will avoid them!)*

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate("addtwo") %>%
  flair('if (type == "add") {
    first_num + second_num
  } else if (type == "subtract") {
    first_num - second_num
  } else {
    stop("Please choose `add` or `subtract` as the type.")
  }')
```

The **return values** of the function are the possible objects that get returned:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate("addtwo") %>%
  flair('first_num + second_num') %>%
  flair('first_num - second_num')
```

When we use a function in code, this is referred to as a **function call**.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
b <- add_or_subtract(1, 2)
```

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
checkin("Function Basics")
```

**Question 1:** What will be returned by each of the following?

i) 1
ii) -1
iii) 30
iv) An error defined in the function `add_or_subtract`
v) An error defined in a different function, that is called from inside `add_or_subtract`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
add_or_subtract(5, 6, type = "subtract")

add_or_subtract("orange")

add_or_subtract(5, 6, type = "multiply")

add_or_subtract("orange", type = "multiply")
```

**Question 2:**

Consider the following code:

```{r}
first_num <- 5
second_num <- 3

result <- 8

result <- add_or_subtract(first_num, second_num = 4)

result_2 <- add_or_subtract(first_num)
```

In your Global Environment, what is the value of...

a) `first_num`
b) `second_num`
c) `result`
d) `result_2`


```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
canvas_task(quiz_url)
```


## Good function design

Most likely, you have so far only written functions for your own convenience. 
(Or for assignments, of course!)

We are now going to be designing functions for *other people* to use and possibly 
even edit them.  This means we need to put some thought into the *design* of the function.

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
req_read("R4DS Chapter 19: Functions", type = "Required", url = "https://r4ds.had.co.nz/functions.html")
```

Designing functions is somewhat subjective, but there are a few principles that apply:

1. Choose a good, descriptive **names** 
    + Your function name should describe what it does, and usually involves a verb.
    + Your argument names should be simple and/or descriptive.
    + Names of variables in the body of the function should be descriptive.
2. Output should be **very predictable**
    + Your function should always *return* the same object type, no matter what input it gets.
    + Your function should expect certain objects or object types as *input*, 
    and give errors when it does not get them.
    + Your function should give errors or warnings for common mistakes.
    + Default values of arguments should only be used when there is a clear common choice.
3. The body of the function should be **easy to read**.
    + Code should use [good style principles](https://style.tidyverse.org/).
    + There should be occasional comments to explain the purpose of the steps.
    + Complicated steps, or steps that are repeated many times, should be written
    into **separate functions** (sometimes called *helper functions*).
4. Functions should be **self-contained**.
    + They should not rely on any information besides what is given as input.
    + *(Relying on other _functions_ is fine, though*)
    + They should not alter the Global Environment
    + *(do not put `library()` statements inside functions!)*




```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
checkin("Function Design")
```

Identify five major violations of design principles for the following function:

```{r}


ugh <- function(dataset) {
  
  library(tidyverse)
  
  thing <- dataset%>%group_by(Species)%>%summarize(newvar = mean(Sepal.Length))
  
  ggplot(thing)+geom_col(aes(x = Species, y = newvar))+ggtitle("Sepal Lengths")
  
  
}

ugh(iris)
```
```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
canvas_task(quiz_url)
```

## Debugging Functions

Suppose you've done it:  You've written the most glorious, beautiful, well-designed
function of all time.  It's many lines long, and it relies on several sub-functions.

You run it and - it doesn't work.

How can you track down exactly where in your complicated functions, something went wrong?


```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
req_vid("Object of type closure is not subsettable", url = 'https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/object-of-type-closure-is-not-subsettable-jenny-bryan', 
        embed = '<p><a href="https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/object-of-type-closure-is-not-subsettable-jenny-bryan?wvideo=3eryv8gcor"><img src="https://embed-fastly.wistia.com/deliveries/2e2c4f025a70aaa1659fa66786570766f9f0f11a.jpg?image_play_button_size=2x&amp;image_crop_resized=960x540&amp;image_play_button=1&amp;image_play_button_color=4287c7e0" width="400" height="225" style="width: 400px; height: 225px;"></a></p><p><a href="https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/object-of-type-closure-is-not-subsettable-jenny-bryan?wvideo=3eryv8gcor">Object of type ‘closure’ is not subsettable - Jenny Bryan</a></p>')
```

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
checkin("Debugging")
```

**Question 1:** What does using the `traceback` approach to debugging **NOT** tell you?

a) The function call that triggered the error.
b) The sub-function where the error actually occurred.
c) The value of the argument or object that caused the error.
d) The text of the full error message.


**Question 2:** Which of the following is **NOT** a disadvantage of using `browser()`?

a) You can't insert it into existing functions.
b) You can't view variables in the function environment when it is running.
c) You have to remember to take it out of your code when you are done with it.
d) You have to run your code line-by-line until you find the error.


**Question 3:**  What is the most fun pronounciation of `debugonce()`

a) "Debug Once"
b) "Debut Gonky"
c) "Debugoncé" like "Beyoncé"

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
canvas_task(quiz_url)
```


## Advanced Details

As this is an Advanced course, let's take a moment to talk about two quirky details
of how R handles functions.

### Objects of type closure

In R, functions are **objects**.  

That is, creating a function is not fundamentally different from creating a vector
or a data frame.

Here we store the vector `1,2,3` in the object named `a`:

```{r}
a <- 1:3

a
```

Here we store the procedure "add one plus one" in the object named `a`:

```{r}
a <- function(){
  1+1
}

a
```

For some strange reason, the word in R that means "object that's a function" is 
**closure**.  Have you ever gotten this error?  

```{r, error = TRUE}
a[1]
```

I bet you have!  What happened here is that we tried to take a subset of the vector 
`a`.  But `a` is a function, not a vector, so this doesn't work!

If you encounter this error in the wild, it's probably because you tried to reference
a non-existant object. However, you used an object name that happens to also be
an existing function.


### Lazy Evaluation

Like most people, R's goal is to avoid doing any unnecessary work.

When you "give" a value to an argument of a function, R does a quick check to make
sure you haven't done anything too crazy, like forgotten a parenthesis.  Then it says,
"Yep, looks like R code to me!" and moves on with its life.

Only when that argument is *actually used* does R try to run the code.

Consider the following obvious problem:

```{r, error = TRUE}
mean('orange')
```

Now consider the following function:

```{r}
silly_function <- function(x) {
  
  cat("I am silly!")
  
}
```

What do you think will happen when we run:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
silly_function(x = mean("orange"))
```

Seems like it should be an error, right?

But wait!  Try it out for yourself.

The function `silly_function` doesn't use the `x` argument.  Thus, R was "lazy", 
and never even bothered to try to run `mean("orange")` - so we never get an error.


### Non-Standard Evaluation and Tunnelling

Suppose you want to write a function that takes a dataset, a categorical variable,
and a quantitative variable; and returns the means by group.


You might think to yourself, "Easy!" and write something like this:

```{r}
means_by_group <- function(dataset, cat_var, quant_var) {
  
  dataset %>%
    group_by(cat_var) %>%
    summarize(means = mean(quant_var))
  
  
}
```


Okay, let's run it!

```{r, error = TRUE}
means_by_group(iris, Species, Sepal.Length)
```

Dagnabbit!  The function tried to group the data by a variable named `cat_var` -
but the dataset `iris` doesn't have any variables named `cat_var`!

What happened here is that the function `group_by` uses **non-standard evaluation**.
This means it has a very special type of input called **unquoted**.  

Notice that we say `group_by(Species)` not `group_by("Species")` - there are no
quotation marks, because `Species` is a variable name, not a string.

In our function, R sees the unquoted variable `cat_var`, and tries to use it in
`group_by`, not realizing that we *actually* meant to pass along the variable name
`Species` into the function.

To solve this conundrum, we use a trick called **tunnelling** to "force" the unquoted
name `Species` through to the function `group_by`.  It looks like this:

```{r mbg, include = FALSE}
means_by_group <- function(dataset, cat_var, quant_var) {
  
  dataset %>%
    group_by({{cat_var}}) %>%
    summarize(means = mean({{quant_var}}))
  
  
}
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate('mbg') %>%
  flair_rx("\\{\\{.*\\}\\}")
```

Note: The tunnel, or "curly-curly" operator, `{{ }}`, is from the *tidyverse* package `rlang`.

Now everything works!

```{r, error = TRUE}
means_by_group(iris, Species, Sepal.Length)
```


In your time as an R developer, you may find yourself wanting to do even more
complicated and fancy functions using non-standard evaluation.  Some of these
require much more complexity than the tunnelling trick - but all is possible!
